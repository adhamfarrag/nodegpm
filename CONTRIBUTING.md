# NodeGPM contributing guide

Welcome! Grateful that you're interested in contributing to this endeavor. This guide will help you get started :)

## Introduction

NodeGPM aims to simplify the management of global Node.js packages across various package managers including npm, yarn, pnpm, and soon bun. It provides a set of utility functions to perform tasks such as installing, removing, detecting globally installed packages, detecting available package managers, and more. By contributing to NodeGPM, you'll be helping to enhance the developer experience and make global package management even more accessible and efficient.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create a robust and user-friendly tool that streamlines the process of managing global Node.js packages. We envision NodeGPM as a go-to solution for developers working across different package managers, ensuring seamless integration into their workflows.

## Repo

Default package manager is PNPM, so make sure you have it installed. Here's a [quick guide](https://pnpm.io/installation) on how to install it.
